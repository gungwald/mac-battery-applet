Because the Power PC Mac has a different type of power unit, the normal battery
applets for Intel hardware do not work. There was an emulator but it is 
non-functional.

I wanted to provide a .deb package. But after reading all the documentation,
rules, commands, processes and procedures associated with doing this, I no
longer have a desire to do it. My goal instead is to make this easy to
compile and install with a simple Makefile. Maybe someone else will suffer
through the process of creating a Debian package.
